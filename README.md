# PY-X Demo Frontend (Static)

Simple static interactive frontend for the PY-X AI Co-Founder demo.
- Open `index.html` locally to test.
- Deploy to Vercel / Netlify by connecting this repo (static site).

Recommended steps:
1. Push files to GitHub repo.
2. Connect repo to Vercel → choose project → deploy (Vercel auto-detect will host static files).
3. Share the deployed URL with judges.

This frontend uses client-side canned replies for a reliable demo recording.
