# CREYEX — AI CO-FOUNDER (Ultra-Premium Demo)

Files:
- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js
- .nojekyll

## Quick test locally
1. Download these files into a folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (Chrome recommended).
3. Type into the input, press Enter — the hero will auto-hide and canned replies will appear.

## Deploy to Vercel
1. Push these files to a GitHub repo.
2. Sign in to https://vercel.com → New Project → import this repo.
3. Deploy (no build step). Vercel serves static files automatically.

## Notes
- UI is designed for recording a demo video: hero appears inside chat, auto-hides on first message.
- Chat uses client-side canned replies for a deterministic, stable demo.
- For connecting to real LLMs / backend features (financial generator, PDF exports) I can add serverless endpoints later.
